The blocking valve must remain in the closed position when the hazard area is occupied and open when the hazard area is not occupied. It is also useful for preventing accidental discharges during maintenance and inspection operations. It is screwed onto the discharge manifold. A 2-pole limit switch (NC / NO) is fitted, set to change state when the valve is opened or closed, and to send an electrical signal to the fire system to warn that the system is isolated or operative. The supply of a new CO2 Manual Blocking Valve is included. Modification to the current CO2 line to fit in the new blocking valve is required. These project-specific adaptation needs to be performed locally during installation."

Other cables under customer responsibility (like boiler signal exchange, MV system references, etc.) may be re-routed from the former control panel location to the new location or replaced by customer (out of Solar Turbines scope of supply). Following the customer request to install the control and auxiliary panels off skid, the off-skid installation distance shall refer to the actual cable routing length from each field device to the new control system panels installed in the control room. Solar Turbines recommends keeping the cable length within approximately 35–40 meters to avoid impacts on cable sizing, voltage drop, and signal integrity. Longer distances (maximum 100 meters) may require cable size upgrades, additional engineering analysis, and potential design modifications. Cable glands, cable trays and modification are also under customer scope. IMPORTANT: Engineer team must provide the cable list."

Considering the site configuration and the latest control and safety requirements, a limited upgrade replacing the gas fuel line downstream the secondary SOV has been included in this proposal. This upgrade consists in installing the new Fuel Control Valve (FCV) PECC 110VDC type, aligned with the latest standard and fully supported, thus reducing downtime in case of issues.
